## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

An equation with numbering

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:1}
  \phi \left( x; \mu, \sigma \right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi \sigma^2}} \exp \left( -
  \frac{\left(x - \mu\right)^2}{2 \sigma^2} \right)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
5 = 2 + 3
\end{equation}

blah blah blah, reference equation \ref{eq:1}
