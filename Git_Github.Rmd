# Workflow

Important considerations for data analysis workflow: 

- **Reproducibility**  
<br>
<br>
<br>
  
- **Version control**  
<br>
<br>
<br>
  
  
- **Collaboration**

# What are git and github?

- **Git** is a version control software  
  
- **Github** is an online hosting service for Git-based projects

## Git Tracking

- You associate git with a folder (repo)

- Git keeps track of all files in the folder (repo)

- If you want to keep changes you've made, you **commit** and **push** the changes to the folder (repo)

# Github

- Github allows you to have a remote file repository (folder) tracked by git

    + Let's create a repository on github.com 

    + **Add** some files and **commit** to the changes
    
    + Modify some files on github
    
    + Investigate the version control!

# Local vs Remote Work

Mostly you'll want to work on your local computer.  Install `git` on your computer!

## Workflow

1. (Initially) **clone** the repo locally.  (Later) **pull** to get most recent versions of files

2. Work and make changes

3. **add** and **commit** to changes you like

4. **push** changes to remote repo (on github)

Let's clone our repo and work on it locally!

# Git & RStudio

Git and RStudio work great together!

- Works through **R Projects**
<br>
<br>
<br>

- Start a new project from git repo

    + Update with command line or git menu!
