- Everyone has a **special** repo that can be used as a homepage

    + Use something like this (`jbpost2.github.io`) as your repository name

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='700px'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/repo_name.png")
```

- Nice to have an offline editor for files

- RStudio works great!  (Also allows for coding/output)

    + Can output to github markdown via `output: github_document` when using R Markdown

    + Let's create an R Markdown doc and output it to see it rendered as a web page!
